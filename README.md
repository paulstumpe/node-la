# Node.LA

## Greetings from Node.LA!

Node.LA utilizes a MERN stack with display views created from data in a __MariaDB__ database using __Sequelize__, and a __FeathersJS__ web server, with an Authentication & Authorization strategy via FeathersJS's __Passport__ adapter. The front-end of this application utilizes __React__ & __Material UI__ for client interaction and styling.

*For the best experience, please view this app in the browser*

### How to Start
From the command line, run: <br>
`npm install`<br>
to install this app's dependencies, then this app can be started by running an instance of a mysql database with:
<br>`brew services start mariadb`<br>
start the web pack builder to watch the build by using: 
<br> `npm run start-client`<br> 
Finally, to start the server run:
<br>`npm run start`<br> 
which will alert you to which port the app is listening on.
